            Story Of Our Journey
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-900 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Plant Peek began as a simple passion project rooted in our love for nature and curiosity about the plant world. While living in our hostel rooms during college, surrounded by textbooks and a few green companions, we noticed how little people actually knew about the plants they cared for.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-900 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            That small observation sparked a big ideaâ€”to create a digital plant encyclopedia that makes plant knowledge simple, beautiful, and accessible to all. What started as a semester project has now grown into a platform designed to bring people closer to nature, one plant at a time.

            At Plant Peek, we do more than share plant factsâ€”we promote a greener, more mindful lifestyle.
            By simplifying plant care, we inspire home gardening and eco-friendly living.
            In the future, we hope to launch green initiatives like tree planting and urban gardening.
            Join us in growing a greener worldâ€”one plant at a time.
